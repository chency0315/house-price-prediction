To understand the impact of the house price, we first need to understand the data values and the distribution of the house prices

# data visualization
After cleaning the data, I drew out a pie chart to find out the ratio of the house prices.

I want to compare each year how the prices of more than 300k and less than 100k differ in quantity.
